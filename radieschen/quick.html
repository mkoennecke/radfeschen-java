<h1>Formatting Help </h1>
<p>The wiki markup used by Radieschen has been compiled from the best markup ideas used in other wiki systems. No surprises here. Please note that 
the html renderering is done by Swing's standard JEditorPane widget. This is a limitation espcially when displaying complex external WWW-pages.
</p><hr>

<h2>Headers <a name="#hd"></a> </h2>
<pre>= Level 1 header = 
== Level 2 Header ==
=== Level 3 Header ===
==== Level 4 header ====
===== Level 5 Header =====</pre>
<p>gives:
</p><h1>Level 1 Header </h1>
<h2>Level 2 Header </h2>
<h3>Level 3 Header </h3>
<h4>Level 4 Header </h4>
<h5>Level 5 Header </h5>
<p>Please note that the = must be at the start of the line; there must be a space between the 
last = and the header text and there must be a line separator after the terminating = at the 
end of the header.
</p><hr>
<h2>Paragraphs <a name="#par"></a> </h2>
<p>This is a paragraph. Please note that a paragraph <b>MUST</b> start at the first character of a line. Otherwise it might be treated as the continuation to a preceeding list item.
</p><p>This is a second paragraph. Paragraphs are separated by empty lines. 
</p><p>Text between two lines starting with :: appears centered. For example:
</p><pre>
::
This is centered 
::</pre>
<p>will give:
</p><center>
<p>This is centered
</p></center>


<p>Text between two lines starting with -- will be treated as a quote. For 
 example:
</p><pre>
--
 This is a quote from an ancient master of wisdom
--</pre>
<p>will yield:
</p><blockquote>
 This is a quote from an ancient master of wisdom
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Text Embellishments </h2>
<ul><li>Enclosing text in '' or ** makes the text bold. Example: ''fat'' gives <b>fat</b>. 
</li><li>Enclosing text in ~~ puts text into italics. Example: ~~italy~~ makes <i>italy</i>.
</li><li>Enclosing text in __ puts text in subscript. Example __sub__script yields <sub>sub</sub>script.
</li><li>Enclosing text in ^ puts text in superscript. Example: ^super^script makes <sup>super</sup>script.
</li><li>Coloured text can be produced by enclosing the text into ~~colourname: 
 and ~~. Example: ~~red:This is red~~ yields: <font color="red">This is red</font> Only the standard 
 html colours are supported.
</li></ul>
<p>Forced line breaks within a paragraph can be obtained by giving %%%.
</p><hr>
<h2>Links </h2>
<ul><li>A link is created by enclosing the URL in []. Example: [http://www.psi.ch] yields <a href="http://www.psi.ch">http://www.psi.ch</a>. All URL's not starting with
  either http or ftp are treated as wiki internal links. Page creation happens by creating a new wiki link in some page. 
</li><li>Optionally the link may be given a differerent name then the URL. The the URL must be followed by a | and the name within the []. Example:
 [http://www.psi.ch|PSI] gives <a href="http://www.psi.ch">PSI</a>. 
</li><li>images can be included by enclosing their URL in [[ ]]; double square brackets. This looks like [[path-to-image]].  
</li></ul><hr>
<h2>Lists </h2>
<p>Nesting differerent list types is not supported. Extending the items text on another line is supported, <b>but</b> the text must not start at the 
 first character of the line.
</p><h3>Itemized Lists </h3>
<pre>
* noeff
** naff
* niff</pre>
<p>gives 
</p><ul><li>noeff
<ul><li>naff
</li></ul></li><li>niff
</li></ul><p>The * character must be at the start of the line; the item text must be separated by a space. Deeper nesting is expressed by giving more *. 
</p><h3>Ordered Lists </h3>
<pre>
# noeff
## naff
# niff</pre>
<p>gives 
</p><ol><li>noeff
<ol><li>naff
</li></ol> </li><li>niff
</li></ol> <p>The # character must be at the start of the line; the item text must be separated by a space. Deeper nesting is expressed by giving more #. 
</p><h3>Definition Lists </h3>
<pre>
;niff: niff text
;noeff: noeff text</pre>
<p>yields
</p><dl><dt>niff
<dd> niff text
</dd><dt>noeff
<dd> noeff text
</dd></dl><p>The ; must be at the start of the line; The definiton text follows after the :. Nesting definition lists is not allowed.
</p><hr>
<h2>Tables </h2>
<p>Simple tables can be done with ||. Example:
</p><pre>
|| t1 || t2 || t3 ||
|| t4 || t5 || t6 ||
|||span 2 || t7||</pre>
<p>creates
</p><table border="1"><tr><td> t1 </td><td> t2 </td><td> t3 </td></tr>
<tr><td> t4 </td><td> t5 </td><td> t6 </td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"> span 2 </td><td> t7</td></tr>
</table><p>Please note the spaces around the table elements. The table row must be terminated with a return after the ||. Elements spanning multiple columns can be created by adding additional | to 
the column separator ||.
</p><hr>
<h2>Rules </h2>
<p>Two types of horizontal rules are supported:
</p><pre>
----</pre>
<p>makes a simple horizontal line like:
</p><hr>
<pre>
------</pre>
<p>makes an emphasized horizontal rule like:
</p><hr size="5">
<h2>Preformatted Text and Escapes <a name="#pre"></a> </h2>
<p>Single characters can be escaped by preceeding them with a backslash. This is useful when using those sysmbols which are special to wiki markup in text. 
Text enclosed in {{{  }}} is treated as preformatted text. 
</p><hr>
<h2>Script generated Content </h2>
<p>It is possible to use the beanshell scripting language within Radieschen files in order to generate content dynamically. This works 
similar to JSP. The follwoing syntax is supported:
</p><dl><dt>&lt;% script %>
<dd>execute script and insert output. The output must be formatted as Radieschen markup. 
</dd><dt>&lt;%=var %>
<dd>insert value of variable named var. 
</dd><dt>&lt;%! script%>
<dd>execute script and print nothing. 
</dd></dl><hr>
