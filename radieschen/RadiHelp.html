<h2>Radieschen Help </h2>
<p>Radieschen is a little personal wiki system. You can view and edit
wiki pages. This can be used as a small personal database, for todo
list, for keeping notes on anything and everyting. The only limit is
your imagination. All wiki pages are stored in a directory on your very own
file system. Both the editor and the HTML rendering system make use of
standard Java swing components. This implies that editing facilities
and HTML display is somehwat limited. In order to cope with this, it
is possible to edit pages in an external editor and to have links
pointing outside your Radieschen wiki to be openened in a more capable
external browser. This help text is about the usage of the Radieschen
program, for help on formatting wiki text, see the formatting help
items in the menus. 
</p><hr>
<h3>Limitations </h3>
<p>Radieschen uses the standard swing widgets for displaying HTML. This is 
sufficient for the Radieschen wiki. However you will frequently
experience that external WWW-pages use technology which is not
supported by the swing HTML widget. The workaround is to display such
pages in an external browser.

<h3>General Layout </h3>
<p>To the left there is the Radieschen logo, a search box and a list of all the
Radieschen files in your current Radieschen directory. To the right is
the central editing and viewing area.  Clicking on any file in the
list will display the corresponding page in the view/edit area.  You
can follow links by clicking on them, like in any other
WWW-browser. There is a back button in the button bar which allows to
go back to the previousy edited page. Radieschen is at any give time
in one of two modes:
</p><dl><dt>Edit Mode
<dd> allows to edit the wiki page.
</dd><dt>View Mode
<dd> allows to navigate the wiki pages and displays them as
 nicely formatted HTML.

<h2>Style Sheet Support </h2>
<p>Radieschen supports CSS style sheets. This means: if you do not like the appearance 
 oh Radieschen rendering, you can do something about it. Radieschen copies into each 
database directory and into each export directory a file called radi.css with style sheet
information. If you want another rendering, edit this file. If you do not know how to do this,
 please consult the ample documentation on cascading style sheets available on the WWW 
and in books.

<p>The Radieschen database can be searched. Underneath the Radieschen logo at the left there 
is text field where you may enter your search string. Hit the button <b>Go</b> besides it and a page
with search results will magically appear. When navigating, the <b>back</b> button will not go back
to the search results. Hit <b>Go</b> instead to get  your search results back.
</p><p>Searching is case insensitive and uses the regular expressions implementation and syntax 
supplied with your JDK.
