# Radieschen

This is a personal wiki system implemented in Java. It has never been used 
by anyone else then me. But for me it is working in a stable way. 

You can run Radieschen through:

    javaws http://lns00.psi.ch/misc/wstart/radieschen.jnlp

Of course, this requires java and java webstart installed. If your browser is suitably 
configured you may even be able to start Radieschen from it by entering the URL above.
I developed Radieschen against JDK 1.4. So any more modern JVM should do. 

## What can Radieschen do for you?

As I said: it is a personal wiki system. You can view wiki pages and edit them. Pages are stored 
on your local hard drive in the directory which you select in Radieschen/Open Radidir

Radieschen also supports exporting wiki pages into a small number  of formats. 


## Requirements

Radieschen needs the following additional resources:

* commons-io-1.2 from Apache
* swixml and jdom
* beanshell 2.+

As I develop Radieschen in Eclipse I do not have any Makefiles at this time. 

## License and Support

You may use this source as you like with one exception: Never, ever make me responsible for any harm which 
comes your way from using Radieschen. 

I may fix bugs if I am interested and they are suitably well documented. No guarantees. 
I am overworked enough. 

## Why this Name?

This name came about because I think that vegetable names are underused as names for software artifacts. 
Also: it is ridiculous.
